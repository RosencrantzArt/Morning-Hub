Morning Club webpage is design just to give enough information about the Morning club and its purpose for the targetgroup, arguments and pull-in quotes etc are mainly thru ads directed to specific targetgroups and orgnanic content in socialmedia. Since the club is not about meeting other people I choose not to have any faces in in the pictures and also no pictures that symbolise different training performance. It also gives the club a more secret vibe but the color and pictures are warm and welcome and also gives a easy,inclusing and simply first impression. 

About Morning Club:
Morning Hub is a virtual community that gathers every morning between 6-8 AM on Slack for a morning huddle. We believe in the power of movement, the rhythm of the morning, and the joy of starting our days on an uplifting note. Our community offers encouragement, accountability, and connection to help you build a vibrant morning routine and make every morning a great start for you. I want it to be a safe place and It is ok to be anonymous.
