## About Morning Club
- Description of Morning Club and its purpose.
- Approach to images and colors for the site.

The Morning Club webpage is designed to provide enough information about the Morning Club and its purpose for the target group. Arguments and compelling quotes are mainly through ads directed to specific target groups and organic content on social media. Since the club is not about meeting other people, I choose not to have faces in the pictures and also no pictures that symbolize different training performances. This gives the club a more secretive vibe, but the color and pictures are warm and welcoming, also giving an easy, inclusive, and simple first impression.


About Morning Club:
The Morning Club is a virtual community that gathers every morning between 6-8 AM on Slack for a morning huddle. We believe in the power of movement, the rhythm of the morning, and the joy of starting our days on an uplifting note.

It's okay to be anonymous, and we strive to create a safe place for everyone.

## Bugs
- Experience with encountering and fixing bugs during development.
I encountered numerous bugs throughout the process, but with invaluable assistance from my classmates, Slack, tutors, ChatGPT, and my mentor, I was able to address them effectively. In hindsight, I realize the importance of documenting these issues before fixing them to maintain clarity and ensure I retain what I've learned, thus avoiding repetition. This experience has taught me the necessity of documenting and committing changes more frequently, in a systematic manner, and being more specific in my commit messages  

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps taken to deploy are as follows:

Log in to Github
Navigate to  in https://github.com/RosencrantzArt/Morning-Hub
the list of repositories
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the [Settings] tab
In Settings scroll down to [GitHub pages] which opens in a new page.
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page is automatically refreshed and a display indicates the successful deployment and the link to the address.

## Learnings

Challenges and lessons learned from deploying the project.
Deploying and committing code has been quite the learning experience for me. Initially, I encountered some issues with the connection between Gitpod and GitHub, which caused some frustration. However, overcoming these challenges has taught me valuable lessons about version control and deployment processes.

One of the key insights I gained was the importance of thoughtful commits. At first, I believed that I needed to commit every change I made, which resulted in a cluttered history and unclear commits. Through trial and error, I learned to be more selective about what to commit, focusing on meaningful changes that align with the project's goals.

Furthermore, I realized the significance of planning and organization in the development process. Instead of diving straight into coding, I now take the time to outline my ideas and create a wireframe. This structured approach helps me visualize the project's structure and identify potential challenges before writing a single line of code.

In analogy, I used to approach coding like sorting through a box of LEGO pieces by color and shape before building. Now, I understand the value of first laying out all the pieces and then assembling them with purpose and clarity.

Searching for answers and AI-generated suggestions during the development process has presented its own set of challenges. Often, when seeking solutions or guidance online, I encountered recommendations that were not directly relevant to my project or even included programming languages unfamiliar to me.

This influx of information, while sometimes overwhelming, served as a reminder of the importance of discernment and critical thinking. I learned to sift through the noise and identify the most applicable solutions for my specific needs, rather than blindly following generic advice.

Moreover, encountering suggestions involving unfamiliar programming languages served as a humbling reminder of the vastness of the tech landscape and the continuous learning journey inherent in software development. While it can be tempting to explore new languages and technologies, I recognized the value in focusing on mastering the tools most relevant to my current project and skillset.
